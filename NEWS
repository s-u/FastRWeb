1.2-0	(2021-11-03)
    o	add support for request headers (#11)
	They are passed as named character vectors in `request$headers`
	where the names as all lower-case. If not present they may be
	`NULL` or `charcter()` so use `length()` to check presence.

	For CGI back-end this is done by parsing the `HTTP_xxx` env vars
	and assigning then to the global environment.
        Note that this incurs a slight performance penalty, so it can be
	diabled by adding `-DNO_HTTP_HEADERS` to `CPPFLAGS`.

	For Rserve/httpd back-end the headers are already parsed for
	cookies so there is no significant penalty.


1.1-4	(2020-03-11)
    o	minor fixes only affecting rare systems:
	- use crypt() where available, do not assume unix is sufficient
	- include <crypt.h> on systems that have it and thus possibly
	  require it in addition so standard headers (like Solaris)

    o	use C++ compiler in configure tests


1.1-3	(2020-03-10)
    o	use AC_LANG_SOURCE() in configure to avoid warnings

    o	minor fix in the documentation


1.1-2	(2020-03-02)
    o	enhance output functions to provide an option to escape
	special HTML characters. This (escape=TRUE)is now the default
	for oprint(), ohead() and otable().

    o	added FastRWeb:::htmlEscape(). It is currently not exported as
	to not clash with htmltools.

    o	append `.pdf` and `.svg` to the temporary file name in
	`WebPlot` for PDF and SVG output, because those back-ends
	always append the extension if not present. Also change
	tag type from "img" to "embed" for PDF and add the correct
	mime type for type="svg".

    o	clean up build system and compiler warnings, restore
	support for Windows including multi-arch builds.
	NOTE: Rcgi executables are now in the $(R_ARCH)
	subdirectory of cgi-bin, so pick the the desired
	architecture and install in cgi-bin as needed.

    o	in Rserve stand-alone setup pass the status code from
	the Status: header to the client in the response (#6)


1.1-1	(2015-07-27)
    o	clear the output buffer before serving run() scripts

    o	using out() on WebPlots will now use dataURI instead
	of temporary files

    o	import Cairo to avoid namespace clash with other packages
	that define Cairo to be something entirely different.


1.1-0   (2012-12-15)
    o	The interface to the R process has been enhanced to support
	request body and other methods including POST. A new global
	variable `request' is a list that is populated with various
	entries pertinent to the request:

        request$uri - URI of the request (used to be request.URI)
        request$method - method type (as string) such as "GET"
	request$c.type - content type of the request body
	request$c.length - length of the request body (-1 if
                           there is no body)
	request$body - raw vector containing the body of the request
        request$client.ip - IP address of the client (as string)
	request$raw.cookies - raw cookie string
	request$path.info - path part beyond the script name

	All strings are guaranteed to be "" if not set.
	request$body will be NULL if there is no body.

    o	The interface to the R process now sets a global variable
	`webapi` which is a real number that defines the version of
	the interface used to pass information. It is now set to 1.1
	and guarantees the information described above. This number
	will be increased in case new features are added to the API
	between the R process and the web server.

    o	FastRWeb now provides an internal `.run()' function which does
	the necessary processing of a request, so additional
	FastRWeb-compliant front-ends are easy to implement by simply
	creating the request structure and calling the `.run()'
	function.

    o	FastRWeb contains an experimental .http.request()
	implementation which can be used with Rserve's HTTP server,
	removing all middle layers - no webserver, CGI or PHP is needed.
	Simply evaluate	`.http.request <- FastRWeb:::.http.request`
	during Rserve startup.

    o	FastRWeb now attempts to parse known content types - not just
	the query string but also "application/x-www-form-urlencoded"
	and multi-part encodings. If the key name is used, query
	string has higher precedence. It is still possible to separate
	the various types by hand from request$body, for multipart
	content content FastRWeb now provides parse.multipart()
	function (courtesy of Jeff Horner).

    o	Rcgi will respond with appropriate status code to various
	error conditions, such as failed connection. Previously, Rcgi
	would always respond with 200 OK.

    o	Rcgi bugfix: the parameter sanitization code was behaving
	improperly.

    o	Rcgi has been updated to switch to binary stdout for file and
	tmpfile on Windows, otherwise binary data (like images) will
	arrive malformed at the webserver when running FastRWeb on
	Windows (thanks to Francois Guillem for reporting and
	testing).

    o	clean up quoting inside attributes in o* tools

    o	added oclear() to re-set output and/or headers

    o	Parameters to run() were passed in URL-encoded form - that was
	a bug. They are now passed in decoded form as intended.
	WARNING: if you worked around this bug in your scripts for
	FastRWeb 1.0 make sure you remove the work around for
	FastRWeb 1.1 and higher (check for the presence of webapi
	if you need to support both).


1.0-1	(2011/12/10)
    o	added rudimentary form elements constructors:
	oinput(), oselection() and osubmit()

    o	some S3 methods were not registered in the namespace


1.0-0	(2011/10/07)
    o	CRAN release

    o	add examples and tmp.R implementation

    o	add support for headers manipulation

    o	add sample project root configuration
	and install.sh for installation


0.1-0	(2008/12/06)
    o	add WebResult and WebPlot classes

	(2008/13/13)
    o	first public version
